  <div class="rant">
    I've been around since Javascript was unpopular;<br>
    When it wasn't a " real " programming language;<br>
    I remember an internet without rounded corners;<br>
    XSS practices existed because of coders like me;<br>
    I said Coffeescript was dumb and now it's dead;<br>
    I prayed for CSS vars then, and I pray for native CSS nesting now;<br>
    I watched jQuery, MooTools, Backbone, Ember rise and fall;<br>
    and I'll write JavaScript well after some blogger writes " Is React.js dead ? ";<br>
    I'll be writing Javascript when AI has Javascript perfected;<br><br>
    I have strong feelings about it.  Hire me.<br>
